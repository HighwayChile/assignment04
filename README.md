and include at least the following JavaScript features:

conditionals,  - DONE

Go find a JavaScript library that has some features that you think might be useful and be ready to discuss  
some of this with the class

    (perhaps by going through a tutorial for that library?)  
  
# DESIGN  

This week, I want to tear down, and rebuild my site in a more intuitive way for the user  
<br>  

# PLANS  
1. create search function  - need more javascript - cancelled for this week  
2. add rating system - two buttons: rough and diamond - cancelled for now  
3. finish movie page design - must make user-submitted review here. - Almost working
4. provide text field for user-provided reviews - input text, submit and write to page?  
    - (method="post" or "get") these are two main methods to send info  
5. add nav menus instead of current tables(also remove side menus from main and styles)  
    get ready for pop-out side-menu. should collapse into side (use collapsable?) - PRIORITIZE
6. perhaps move the movielist/loulist to the browse page - DONE
7. must change the "loulsit" id for the loulist cells. Those should be a class, if anything.  - DONE
8. make pages, scripts, and the rest in their own folders  - DONE
9. For library portion: use: ReactJS(react.js), Angular.js, Node.js, Socket.io



# REFLECTION NOTES

So tired... wish I had got more done. I am considering moving on to a different site next week, but I  
kinda like louvie.com
