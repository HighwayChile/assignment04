# DESIGN  

This week, I want to tear down, and rebuild my site in a more intuitive way for the user  
I also want to add user interactivity in search and user ratings/reviews  
<br>  

# PLANS  
1. create search function  
2. add rating system - two buttons: rough and diamond  
3. finish movie pages/write unique reviews  
4. provide text field for user-provided reviews - input text, submit and write to page?  
    - (method="post" or "get") these are two main methods to send info  
5. add nav menus instead of current tables  
6. perhaps move the movielist/loulist to the browse page  
7. must change the "loulsit" id for the loulist cells. Those should be a class, if anything.  
8.
