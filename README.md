# REQUIREMENTS
Create a webpage with enough elements and styles that allow you to show off some JavaScript capabilities  
and include at least the following JavaScript features:  
input (perhaps using an input element),  
output (maybe inside a <p> or in a fancier element),  
variables of a few datatypes (at least number, string, boolean, and a couple objects),  
show off some common errors and how you might avoid them,  
conditionals,  
repetition,  
arrays,  
functions,  
demonstrate scope,  
objects and events  


Go find a JavaScript library that has some features that you think might be useful and be ready to discuss  
some of this with the class  

    Attempt to use that library to create another page that demonstrates some key features of the library  
    (perhaps by going through a tutorial for that library?)  
  
# DESIGN  

This week, I want to tear down, and rebuild my site in a more intuitive way for the user  
I also want to add user interactivity in search and user ratings/reviews (form and method is the way (post or get))  
<br>  

# PLANS  
1. create search function  - need more javascript - cancelled for this week
2. add rating system - two buttons: rough and diamond  
3. finish movie page design - must make user-submitted review here.
4. provide text field for user-provided reviews - input text, submit and write to page?  
    - (method="post" or "get") these are two main methods to send info  
5. add nav menus instead of current tables  PRIORITIZE
6. perhaps move the movielist/loulist to the browse page  PRIORITIZE
7. must change the "loulsit" id for the loulist cells. Those should be a class, if anything.  - DONE
8. make pages, scripts, and the rest in their own folders  - DONE
